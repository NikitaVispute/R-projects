This folder contains<br>
1. Report<br>
2. R code<br>
3. Data<br>

The datasets have been uploaded in original datasets folder.Path must be changed accordingly in the code.<br>
Newly created merged datasets were first written into a file in a local location and then pushed onto the UTD personal website. <br>
These new datasets are directly read into the R code from the UTD personal website.<br>
These new datasets have also been uploaded to the Data folder as <br>
1. TransactionData-market_basket_transactions zipped folder<br>
2. TransactionData1-market_basket_transactions1 zipped folder<br>
Path must be changed accordingly in the code at the appropriate lines to retrieve the new data into the code.<br>

Report contains detailed explanation and plots and output for each of the 4 steps.<br>
